# Octagon Variable
This is the repository of the collaborative type design project *Octagon Variable* made at the design department of the HAW Hamburg in 2022.

## Information
Based on *Octagon* – a wood type first shown in George Nesbitt’s *First Premium Wood Types Cut by Machinery* in 1838 – *Octagon Variable* is a reimagination of the original design by Edwin Allen as variable font in which the already present spatial illusions are pushed further. It was collaboratively redrawn with students at the design department of the Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg in 2022 as part of a first year type design introduction class under the guidance of Prof. Pierre Pané-Farré and Simon Thiefes.
